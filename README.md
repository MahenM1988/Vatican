# Bible Verse Game

This app renders a random verse from the Holy Bible and asks the user for the verse reference. If the incorrect reference is entered, the correct reference is displayed briefly, and another verse appears, continuing the game. If the correct reference is entered, the following message is displayed:

**"HITHERTO SHALL THOU COME, BUT NO FURTHER!" - JOB 38:11**

The game then continues.

## Data Source

The verses and verse references are stored in a JSON file. This data was extracted from pythonbible using a custom script.
